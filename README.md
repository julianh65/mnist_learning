todo

note: no gpt / claude / llm code copy pasting, can look up documentation obvs though
note: no using torch.nn, ok to use torch but implement everything myself

1. import and load dataset
2. load the dataset into tensors
3. write something to visualize some samples with the labels
4. try to straight feed it into an MLP and see what type of performance I can get
5. tweak settings and hyper params to improve performance
6. create quick local html / css / js file to "draw" examples and get the output in tensors
7. view some sota applications and see how others are doing it
